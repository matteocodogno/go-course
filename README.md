# Go course

## Advantages of `go`

1. Code runs fast (why it runs fast)
2. Garbage collector, some other languages that run fast as Go does they don't have garbage collection
3. Simpler object, object orientation is a little simplified as compared with other languages
4. efficient concurrency implementation built into language

## Code runs fast

Three categories of languages:
1. machine language - low level language and it's directly executed on the CPU (simple, small test. e.g. add, move, read from registry etc..) 
2. assembly language - equivalent to machine language but easier to read. Map one-to-one the machine language (not completely but very close) equivalent, but you can read it because it's english. When you want to something very fast and really efficiently then you'll write it directly in assembly language.
3. high level language - everything else, they are much easier to use. Go is high level language!

> All software must be translated into the machine language of processor

If you've got a processor, i7 or whatever processor you're working with, that processor does not know C or Java or Python or Go or C++ or any of those, right?  
All it knows is its own machine language, say x86 machine language. So C, Python, Java or whatever it is, has to be translated. There is software translation step that has to go on:
1. **Compiled** - high level language to machine code happened one time before you execute the code. Translation occurs once, and when you run the code you are just running the machine code directly.
2. **interpreted** - instructions are translated while the code is excuted. So the translations occurs every time you run the Python code and so that slows you down.

Compiled code is generally faster to execute.
Interpreters make coding easier: manage memory automatically and infer variable types.

Go is a good compromise between compiled and interpreted languages, it is compiled language but it has some good features of interpreted languages.

## Garbage collection

Automatic memory management
- where should memory be allocated?
- when can memory be deallocated?

Manual memory management is hard
- Deallocated too early, false memory access
- Deallocated too late, wasted memory

Go has garbage collector, downside is that it slows  down exection a bit, but it is an efficient garbage collector.

## Objects

Go language is object-oriented -> weakly object-oriented. It implements objects but they have fewer features than you would see in another object-oriented language.

### Object-oriented

- Object-oriented programming is for code organization (encapsulation).
- Group code together data and function which are related.
- User-defined type which is specific to an application.
    - generic type -> `ints` have data (the number) and functions (*, +, - etc.)
    - e.g. 3d geomtric applcication -> `point(x, y, z) { DistToOrigin(), Quadrant() }`  
      difference between object and class
      
### Object in Go

- does not use `class` but use `structs`
- simplified implementation of classes
    - no inheritance
    - no constructors
    - no generics
    
This makes it easier to code and it makes it efficient to run. But if you like these features this is a disadvantage.

## Concurrency

There are built-in constructs in the language that make it easy to use concurrency.

A lot of motivation for concurrency comes from the need for speed, not all.  
How concurrency get around these performance limitations.

### Performance limitation of computers

- Moore's Law used to help performance  
  number of transistors on a chip doubles every 18 months.
- more transistors used to lead to higher clock frequencies  
  Programmers would get lazy, because they knew that pretty soon hardware people would double the number of transistors and fixed all their problems for them, but that si not happening anymore, because Moore's Law had to slow down.
- Power/temperature constraints limit clock frequency now  
  So you can't keep increasing the clock rates.

How do you get performance improvement even though you can't just crank up the clock?

### Parallelism

- Increase number of cores
- you can perform multiple tasks at the same time
    - it does not necessarily improve your latency but your throughput will improve (potentially) ðŸ¤ž
- Difficult with parallelism
    - when do tasks start/stop?
    - what if one task needs data from another task? How does this data transfer occur?
    - Do tasks conflicts in memory?  
    You do not want one task to write to its variable A and that overrides vairable B of another task.
    Code that can be executed in parallel can be difficult.

### Concurrency programming

- Concurrency is management of multiple tasks at the same time  
  They might not actually be executed at the same time (e.g. single core processor) but they are alive at the same time. So they could be executed at the same time if you had the resource.
- Key requirement for large systems  
  You want to be able to consider 20 things at one time.
- Concurrent programming enables parallelism
    - Management of task execution
    - Communication between tasks
    - Synchronization between tasks  
    So You can not just take a piece of regular code and say oaky I'm going to run it on 5 cores, that won't work. The programmer has to decide hot to partition this code (I want this data here and this data there etc.).  
  The program is making these decisions that allow these things to run in parallel.

### Concurrency in go

- Go includes concurrency primitives
- **Goroutines** represent concurrent tasks
- **Channels** are used to communicate between tasks
- **Select** enables task synchronization
- Concurrency primitives are efficient and easy to use

## Install Go

```brew install go```

## Workspaces and packages

### Workspace

Workspace is a directory where your Go stuff will go.

- hierarchy of directories
- Common organization is good for sharing  
  You never programming alone, you can work with people all over the place, and they have to be able to work with your code (merge, link, review, edit). So it is nice have a common standardized organization of your files.
- Three subdirectories
    1. src - Contains source code files
    2. pkg - Contains packages (libraries)
      Packages that you are going to link in that you need
    3. bin - Contains executables
      your compiled executables
- Directory hierarchy is recommended, not enforced.
- Workspace directory defined by **GOPATH** environment variable.

### Packages

- Group of related files
- Each package can be imported by other packages
- The first line of file names the package  
  `package mypackage`
  ```go
    import (
        mypackage
    )
  ```
- There must be one package called `main`  
  That's where the execution starts.
- Building the main package generate an executable program  
  when you build a non main package does not make it executable
- Main package needs have a function called `main()`
- `main()` is where code execution starts

## Go tool

### import

- `import` keyword is used to access other packages
- Go standard library includes many packages  
  i.e. "fmt" - printf statement
- Searches directories spefified by `GOROOT` and `GOPATH`
  if you import packages from some other place you have to change `GOROOT` and `GOPATH` so that it can find them
  
### Go Tool (CLI)

- Tool to manage Go source code
- Several commands
- `go build` - compiles the program  
  arguments can be a list of packages ora a list of `.go` files
  creates an executable for the main package, same name as the first `.go` file
- `go doc` - prints documentation for a package
- `go fmt` - format source code files
- `go get` - download packages and install them
- `go list` - list all the install packages
- `go run` - compiles go files and runs the executable
- `go test` - runs tests using files ending in `_test.go`
 
## Variables

- names must start with a letter
- any number of letters, digits or underscores
- case sensitive
- don't use keywords (`if`, `case`, `package` etc..)
- data stored in memory
- must have a **name** and a **type**.
  `var x int`
- can declare many on the same line
  `var x, y int`
- type defined the values a variable may take and operation that can be performed on it
- How much space in memory you are going to need to allocate for this variable 
  - integer
  - floating point
  integer division is different from floating point division (depends on hardware) 
  - Strings

- You can define an alias, an alternative name for a type, some time is useful for improve clarity.  
e.g. `type Celsius float64` or `type IDnum int`
- you can declare variables using the type alias  
e.g. `var temp Celsius` or `var pid IDnum`

### Variable initialization

- initialize in declaration `var x int = 100` or `var x = 100` - infer the type
- initialize after declaration `var x int` and then `x = 100`
- uninitialized variables have a zero value `var x int // x = 0` or `var x string // x = ""`
- Short variable declaration

`x := 100`

variable is declared as the type of expression on the right hand side  
Can only do this inside a function.

---

## Pointers

- Pointer is an address to data in memory

Two main operators that are associated with Pointers:
1. **&** operator returns the address of a variable/function
2. (*) operator returns data at an address (dereferencing) - If you put that in front of a Pointer to some address, put that in front of an address it will return you the data at that address. 

**e.g.**

```go
var x int = 1
var y inst
var ip *int // ip is pointer to int

ip = &x // ip noi points to x
y = *ip // y is now 1
```
 
### New

- Alternate way to create a variable
- `new()` function creates a variable and return a pointer to the variable
- Variable is initialized to zero

```go
ptr := new(int)
*ptr = 3 // the value three is placed at the address specified by PTR
```  

## Variable Scope

- The places in code where a variable can be accessed
```go
var x = 4

func f() {
    fmt.Printf("%d", x)
} 
func g() {
    fmt.Printf("%d", x)
}
```

```go
func f() {
    var x = 4
    fmt.Printf("%d", x)
} 
func g() {
    fmt.Printf("%d", x)
}
```

Function `g` will have no reference to `x`.

### Blocks

- A sequence of declarations and statements within matching brackets, {}
- Hierarchy of implicit blocks also
    - Universe block - all go source
    - Package block - all source in a package
    - File block - all source in a file
    - "if", "for", "switch" - all code inside the statement
    - Clause in "switch" or "select" - individual clauses each get a block 

There implicit blocks that you do not have to put explicit curly brackets for.

### Lexical Scoping

- Go is a lexical scoped language using blocks
  `bi >= bj` if `bj` is defined inside `bi` 

## Deallocating Memory

Once you declare a variable and your code is running your space needs to be allocated somewhere in memory for that variable, at some point that space has to be deallocated. When you're done using it all right.

- When a variable is no longer needed, it should be deallocated
  - memory space is made available
- Otherwise, we will eventually run out of memory
```go
func f() {
    var x = 4
    fmt.Printf("%d", x)
} 
```
  Now say you call in your program you call this function `f` 100 times right, then it's going to allocate 100 different spaces for this variable X right.

### Stack vs Heap

- stack is dedicated to function call
  - local variables are stored here
  - deallocated after function completes (Go changes this a little bit)
- Heap is persistent
  - Data on the heap must be deallocated when it is done being used
  - in most compiled language (i.e. C) this is done manually
   `x = malloc(32)` and `free(x)`
  - Error prone, but fast  

## Garbage collector

- hard to determine when a variable is no longer use
  you do not want to deallocate a variable and later need that variable that you deallocated
```go
func foo() *int {
    x := 1
    return &x
}

func main() {
    var y = *int
    y = foo()
    fmt.Printf("%d", *y)
}
```
  This code is illegal in certain language, but it is legal in Go.  
  When the function ends that variable x should be deallocated, but in this case it's not the case because is returning a pointer to x.
  Pointers make it difficult ot tell when deallocation is legal and when it is not.
- In interpreted languages this is done by the interpreter
  - Java Virtual Machine
  - Python Interpreter
  Once it determines that a variable is definitely not used, there no more pointers, no more references to that variable then the garbage collector deallocates it.
- Easy for the programmer (Deallocating memory is a big headache)
- Slow (need an interpreter)
- Go is a compiled language with enables garbage collection
- Implementation is fast
- Compiler determines stack vs heap
  it'll figure out this needs to go heap, this needs to go to the stack and it'll garbage collect appropriately.
- Garbage collection in the background
  It slows things down a little bit but it is a great advantage

## Integers

- Generic int declaration
  `var x int`
- Different lengths and signs
  int8, int16, int32, int64,
  uint8, uint16, uint32, uint64 // can get larger
  you can control the integer size by specifying what size integer you want 
- Binary operators
  Arithmetic: =, -, *, /, %, <<, >>
  Comparison: ==, !=, >, <, >=, <=
  Boolean: &&, ||

### Type conversions

```go
var x int32 = 1
var y int16 = 2
x = y // this instruction will fail, because x and y have different types

x = int32(y)
```
## Floating point

Real numbers

- float32 - ~6 digits of precision
- float64 - ~15 digits of precision
```go
var x float64 = 123.45 // decimal
var y float64 = 1.2345e2 // scientific notation
```
- complex numbers rapresented as  two floats: real and imaginary
```go
var x complex128 = complex(2, 3)
```

## String

### ASCII and UNICODE

Each character has to be coded according to a standardized code.

- American Standard Code for Information Exchange 
- Each character is associated with an (7) 8-bit number
  'A' = 0x41
  ASCII can represent 256 possible characters
- Unicode is a 32-bit  character code
- UTF-8 is a sub set of Unicode. It can be 8-bit but it can go up to 32-bit.
  The first set of UTF-8 match ASCII
- Default in `go` is UTF-8
- Code points - Unicode characters
- Rune - code point in `go`

String are arbitrary sequence of bytes rapresented in UTF-8

- Sequence of arbitrary bytes
  - Read-only, you cannot modify a string, you can create a new string that is a modified version of existing string
  - often meant to be printed
  - String literal - notable by double quotes `x := "Hi there"`
    Each byte is a rune (UTF-8 code point)
    
The `rune` type is an alias for `int32`, and is used to emphasize than an integer represents a code point.

## Unicode package

- Provides a set of functions to test categories of runes
  `isDigit(r rune)`
  `isSpace(r rune)`
  `isLetter(r rune)`
  `isLower(r rune)`
  `isPunct(r rune)`
- Perform conversions
  `toLower(r rune)`
  `toUpper(r rune)`

## Strings package

- Functions to manipulate UTF-8 encoded strings
  - compare
  - contains
  - hasPrefix
  - index
  
### String manipulation

- Strings are immutable, but modified strings are returned
  - replace
  - toLower
  - toUpper
  - trimSpace
  
### Strconv package

- conversion to and from string representations of basic data types
  - `Atoi(s)` convert string s to int
  - `Itoa(s)`
  - `FormatFloat(f, fmt, prec, bitSize)`

## Constants

- Expression whose values is known at compile time
- Type is inferred from righthand side
```go
const x = 1.3
const (
	y = 4
	z = "Hi"
)
```


### iota

- `iota` is a function to generate constants, it generates a set of related but distinct constants.
- Often rapresents a property which has several distinct possible values
  - e.g. days of the week
  - e.g. months of the year
- Constants must be different but actual value is not important
- Like enumerated type in other languages

```go
type Grades int
const (
	A Grades = iota
	B
	C
	D
	F
)
```

- Each constants is assigned to a unique integer
- Starts at 1 and increments

## Control flow

Control Flow describes the order in which statements are executed inside a program.

### Control Structures

Statements that alter control flow

### `if` 
```go
if x > 5 {
	fmt.Printf("Yup")
}
```

### `for`

iterates while a condition is true

```go
for i:=10; i < 10; i++ {
	fmt.Printf("Hi")
}
```

### `switch`

is a multi-way if statements

```go
switch x {
case 1:
	fmt.Printf("case1")
case 2:
    fmt.Printf("case2")
default:
    fmt.Printf("nocase")
}
```
- The `case` automatically breaks at the end of the case

- Normal switches have a tag, but sometimes switch may not contain tag.
- Case expression contains a boolean expression to evaluate
- First true case is executed

```go
switch {
case x > 1:
	fmt.Printf("case1")
case x < -1
	fmt.Printf("case 2")
default:
	fmtp.Printf("nocase")
}
```

### `break` and `continue`

```go
for i := 0; i < 10; i ++ {
	if i == 5 { break }
    fmt.Printf("Hi ")
}
```

```go
for i := 0; i < 10; i ++ {
    if i == 5 { continue }
    fmt.Printf("Hi ")
}
```

### `scan`

- `scan` reads user input - it blocks the execution and waits until the user types in something and hits Enter
- Takes a pointer as an argument
- Typed data is written to pointer
- Returns the number of scanned items

```go
var appleNum int

fmt.Printf("Number of Apples: ")
num, err := fmt.Scan(&appleNum)
fmt.Printf(appleNum)
```

## Array

- fixed length series of elements of a chosen type
- element accessed using subscript notation `[`, `]` <-- index in the middle of the square brackets
- Indices start at 0
- Elements are initialized to zero value

```go
var x [5]int

x[0] = 2
fmt.Printf(x[1])
```

### Arrau literal

- array pre-defined with values
`var x [5]int = [5]{1, 2, 3, 4, 5}`
- lenght of literal must be the same of array
- `...` for size in array literal infers size from number of initializers
`x := [...]int{1, 2, 3}`
  
### Iterating through arrays

- user for loop with the range keyword
```go
x := [...]int {1, 2, 3}

for i, v := range x {
	fmt.Prinf("ind %d, val %d", i, v)
}
```

- range returns 2 values: index and element at index

## Slice

- A "window" on an underlying array (a piece of it)
- Variable size up to the whole array

Every slice has three properties:
- Pointer: indicates the start of the slice
- Length: number of element in the slice
- Capacity: maximum number of elements

```go
arr := [...]string{"a", "b", "c", "d", "e", "f", "g"}

s1 := [1:3]  
s2 := [2:5]  
```
- We use colon inside the square bracket to define the beginning and the ends of the slide
- The second slice includes c, d, e but not f. The second number after the colon is just after the end.
- Slice can overlap and refer the same element inside the underlying array

### Length and Capacity

- Two functions `len()` and `cap()`

```go
a1 := [3]int{1, 2, 3}
sli1 := [0:1]
fmt.Printf(len(sli1), cap(sli1))
// Result is "1 3"
```

### Accessing slices

- Writing to a slice changes the underlying array
- Overlapping slices refer the same array elements

```go
arr := [...]string{"a", "b", "c", "d", "e", "f", "g"}

s1 := [1:3]  
s2 := [2:5]

fmt.Printf(s1[1])
fmt.Printf(s2[0])
// These 2 statements print the same thing
```

### Slice Literals

- Can be used to initialize a slice
- Creates the underlying array and creates a slice to reference it
- Slice points to the start of the array, length is capacity
- `sli := []int{1, 2, 3}` it is a slice because it does not have the array size or `...` keyword between the brackets

### Make

- Create a slice (and array) using make
- 2-argument version: type and length/capacity
`sli = make([]int, 10)`
- 3-argument version: type, length and capacity separately
`sli = make([]int, 10, 15)`
- The third argument is the size of the array

### Append

- Size of a slice can be increased by `append()`
- Adds elements to the end of the slice
- Insert into the underlying array, and it increases the size of the underlying array if necessary.
```go
  var sli = make (int[], 0, 3)
  sli = append(sli, 100)
```

## Hash Table

- Contains key/value pairs - e.g. SSN/Email or GPS cord/address
- Each value is associated with a unique key
- Hash function is used to compute the slot for a key
  We can access things in constant time
  
### Tradeoff of Hash Tables

Advantages

- Faster lookup than list
  Constant time vs linear-time
- Arbitrary keys
  no int like slice or array

Disadvantages

- May have collision
  Two keys hash to same slot

## Maps

- Implementation of Hash Table
- Use `make()` to create a Map

```go
var idMap map[string]int
idMap = make(map[string]int)
```

- May define a map literal

```go
idMap := map[string]int{ "Joe": 3 }
```

### Accessing Map

- referencing a value with [key]
- Returns zero if key is not present
  `fmt.Printf(idMap["Joe"])`
- Adding key/value pair into the map
  `idMap["jane"] = 42`
- Delete key/value pair from the map
  `delete(idMap, "Joe")`

### Map functions

- Two-value assignment tests for existence of the key
  `id, p = idMap["Joe"]`  
  `p` is true if the key is present in the map
- `id` is the value, `p` is presence of key
- `len()` returns number of values
  `fmt.Printf(len(idMap))`

### Iterating Through a Map

- Use for loop with `range` keyboard
- Two-value assignment with range
```go
for key, value := range idMap {
	fmt.Printf(key, val)
}
```

## Structs

- Aggregate data type
- Groups together other objects or arbitrary type
  Useful for organization purpose, it brings together variables that are releated
  e.g.  Person struct  
  - Name, Address, Phone

```go
type struct Person {
	name string
	address string
	phone string
}
var p1 Person
```

- Each property is a field
- `p1` contains values for fields

### Accessing Structure fields

- Use dot notation

```go
p1.name = "Joe"
x = p1.address
```

### Initialize Structs

- Can use `new()`
- Initialize fields to zero (for `Person` structure this means that all fields are initialized with empty string)
  `p1 := new(Person)`
- Can initialize using a struct literal
  `p1 := Person(name: "joe", address: "a st.", phone: "123")`
